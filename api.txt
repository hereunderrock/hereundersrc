need to grab list of all(if not, use separate repo to update that list)

and be able to read and write singular strings or images


get list
GET
api.github.com/repos/hereunderrock/img/contents
this works w/o auth
returns array of all files
use .path to get "c1.jpg", or "c 4.jpg"
1.4kB + .1kB per image in size


get one specific
GET

----
what are the api limits? are they per client, or per IP address?

heres what im thinking:
repo /img/ contains everything.
mostly imgs base64
file index.json contains the index table for all the images, 
{
  [
	path: "c" + <img id> + ".jpg",
	likes: int,
	note: "",
	hourglass: bool
  ],...
}

admin upload on upload will auth token,
