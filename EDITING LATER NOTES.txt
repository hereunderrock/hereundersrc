all pages have an initial cartoon str/.loc e.g. "?c=<some cartoon _id>", and this single initial list is populated by
NavPage.js


all pages themselves then define how to list the list under the cartoon "buildList"


App.js has all of the page routing, NavPage only does navigation output


any title, location, footnote, hourglass, likes, or mormon edits should be done with mongodb, login w/ what is is my keepass(under web servers)
